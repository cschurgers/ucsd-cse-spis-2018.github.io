# Why this Reading Assignment?

Actually, this is really a "listening" assignment. The idea is to get you ready and prepared for Tuesday's lecture on the basics of electronics. But additionally, it will introduce you to teaching styles knows as "peer instruction" and a "flipped classroom", which are probably very different from what you are used to. In fact, peer instruction is very different from how most classes are taught at UCSD. However, in the CSE department, you will encounter several classes that do follow this structure, and this assignment, combined with the electronics lecture, will give you a little taster. Also, it is the best way to get the most out of the limited time you have to try to grasp the basic of electronics.

For this assignment, you are expected to watch all the videos mentioned in the writeup, by the due date.


# What is Peer Instruction?
Peer instruction is an educational methodology, a way of teaching classes. Well, you might wonder: Aren't classes just lectures? Why something different? To answer these questions, we should wonder "how do we learn?". Watch this short excerpt (2 min) from an interview with the inventor of peer instruction, Prof Eric Mazur: [Eric Mazur: Key Points of Flipping a Classroom](https://youtu.be/JAdpHs-Dt64).

In a flipped classroom setting, the idea is to move the actual transmission of information to outside of the classroom. The students are responsible for getting the 'lecture information' on their own, through reading the book or watching video lectures. The limited time you have with instructors is then used much more efficiently by focussing on the most important step: the assimilation of the information. In class, the goal is to think, to be questioned, to discuss, and to talk to each other. The latter is called peer instruction, a critical component of learning, where you learn not just from the teacher but also from each other. You have already experienced some peer instruction through the clicker questions in class. But this essentially takes it a step further.

Now, to summarize the entire idea and the motivations behind hit, watch this short (3 min) video: [Eric Mazur & Peer Instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPnijSecLK0).

If you want to learn more, there is this interesting talk by Eric Mazur gave at the University of Michigan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UJRNRdgyvE. Watching this video is optional (it is 1h20min).



# Let's Do some Flipped Classroom Learning

Hopefully by now, you are somewhat convinced that there may be some benefit to a flipped classroom, or at least you are somewhat curious about it. Well, we are going to try it out.

So we are going to use peer instruction to teach you the basics of electronics. This will be useful for lab08, and robotics. And for those who are in CE, this is the start of ECE35, one of the classes you have to take anyway.

Your assignment is this: Before Tuesday class, you have to watch (and try to understand) this video lecture (26 min): [Basic Electronics - The Hydraulic Analogy](https://youtu.be/7CNZfMI_njg).

See you all in class!

# WIP

So you followed the instructions from this [article](/webapps/oauth_actually), but when you got your Heroku app link, nothing shows up. Or you were wondering what the `env.sh.sample` file was or did in some of the example repos. Or you just wanted to know how to be able to run your webapp locally with OAuth.

In this article, we'll go over how to set up your local workstation to be able to run your webapp locally with OAuth. In doing so, we can hopefully debug our webapp easier to be able to figure out why it's not working properly on Heroku. In addition, we'll cover how to have print statements in Flask, giving us another tool in debug toolbox.

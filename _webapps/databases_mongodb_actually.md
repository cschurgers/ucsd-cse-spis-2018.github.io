# Now, let's go through the steps to implement a MongoDB Database

## Step 1: Install `Flask-PyMongo` Python Module 

There is a Python module called [Flask-PyMongo](http://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that we can install with `pip install` to make working with MongoDB easier.

To install it on ACMS, use:

```
pip install --user Flask-PyMongo
```

on Windows or Mac, just:

```
pip install Flask-PyMongo
```

## Step 2: Add to your `requirements.txt`

You'll also need to make sure that you add these lines to the `requirements.txt` file for any webapp that you want to 
run on Heroku with MongoDB:

```
Flask-PyMongo==0.4.1
pymongo==3.3.0
```

## Step 3: Create an mLab account on mlab.com

Go to <https://www.mlab.com> and follow the instructions on the website to create a mLab account. The account name can be the name of your Web App project. You will also a receive an email, asking you to confirm your account.

## Step 4: Creating a Database (MongoDB Deployment)

Once you've created an account on mLab, we're create a deployment for your database. Make sure you are logged in and on your home page. 

1. Create a new database by clicking the `Create new` under the MongoDB Deployments.

2. You will then be taken to a different page to choose a provider and a plan. Make sure that the plan you choose is the one that is free, that is, the 'Sandbox' plan with up to 0.5GB of storage. For the provider, we will stick with the default of Amazon Web Services.

3. Next, you will be asked to choose a region. Select 'US East (Virginia)' and click the continue button.

4. You are then asked to choose a database name. Choose something that make sense for your application. For example, if your database is storing information about cars, call it `carsdb` or just `cars`. If you donâ€™t have an application in mind, you can just use `testdb`. After choosing your name, click continue.

5. Finally, review all the details to make sure they're correct and click 'Submit Order'.

## Step 6: Implement MongoDB in your Python file
